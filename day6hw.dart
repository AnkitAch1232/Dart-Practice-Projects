// Assignment: Understanding Classes and Objects
// Question 1: Class Definition and Object Creation
// Define a class named Car that has the following attributes:

// make (a string representing the manufacturer)
// model (a string representing the model of the car)
// year (an integer representing the manufacturing year)
// Then, create an object of the Car class with the following details: 
//make: "Toyota", model: "Camry", year: 2021. Print out the details of this car.

// Question 2: Methods in a Class
// Expand the Car class from Question 1 to include a method named display_info 
//that prints the details of the car in the format: "Make: {make}, Model: {model}, Year: {year}".

// Create an object of the Car class and call the display_info method to print the car details.

// Question 3: Initializing Objects
// Modify the Car class to include an _init_ method that initializes the attributes 
//make, model, and year when an object is created.

// Create an object of the Car class using the _init_ method and initialize it with 
//the following details: make: "Honda", model: "Civic", year: 2020. Print out the 
//details of this car using the display_info method.

// Question 4: Multiple Objects
// Create three different objects of the Car class with the following details:

// Make: "Ford", Model: "Mustang", Year: 2018
// Make: "Chevrolet", Model: "Impala", Year: 2019
// Make: "Tesla", Model: "Model S", Year: 2022
// Use the display_info method to print out the details of each car.

// Question 5: Modifying Object Attributes
// Create an object of the Car class with the following details: make: "BMW", model: "X5", year: 2017.

// After creating the object, modify the year attribute to 2021. Print out the
// updated details of the car using the display_info method.

// Instructions:
// Write the Python code to define the Car class as specified in each question.
// Create the objects and call the methods as required.
// Ensure your code runs without errors and produces the expected output.
// Submit your Python script or notebook with the implementedÂ solutions.
